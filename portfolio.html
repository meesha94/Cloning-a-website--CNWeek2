<h4>Code Nation</h4>

<p class="para1"> 
    I was interested in joining Code Nation as I really enjoyed the Develop coding course and wanted to continue learning more about how to code and what else we can do with it.  
</p>


<h5>Goals and Progress</h5>


<p class="para2" contenteditable="true"> 
   My targets for this course are to expand my code knowledge, I will do this by trying my best and working hard to understand the activites and try to solve any challaneges first by myself and then asking for help if I still don't understand.
<br> This text can be edited to update goals.
